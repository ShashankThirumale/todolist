#TodoList App
##Reason for Creation
This is an app meant to boost the productivity of users. I personally can be very forgetful and having a place to put all my tasks down and physically stike them out helps me stay on task.
I created this app as a fun way to learn more about how to develop a full stack application but also as a way to make my own life much easier. I know that there are many other applications
out there that allow users to accomplish similar things and that is why after this project I plan to create another project called College Calendar which will be much harder but will also
be much more unique and will defiently help a lot more college students with their college assignments. 

##Project Description
There is a login page where the users can either sign up or login to their existing account. The login information of the user is stored in a SQL database. 
After login the user will see all of the tasks that they created in the past. All of the tasks that they user has created is stored into a table in a SQL database along with the status of the
task and the task's id. 
The users have the ability to create new tasks, mark tasks as complete by clicking on the task, and delete the tasks. I am currently storing all the changes made to a task in a table in the 
SQL database to hopefully make it so that users can bring back a task incase it was a mistake.

##What are things that need to be added
1. A icon to tell if a user is logged in.
2. A way to bring back tasks that were deleted
3. Authentication with Google
